# SinterMetaverse
Course project on React. This is one of my first large front-end pet projects. 
His goal was not so much to create a very cool and stable application, but to get new experiences and get acquainted with new technologies. 
A basic chat was implemented here using Next JS, Firebase and Chakra for UI. 
Despite such a remarkable stack, I implemented a lot of new things for myself and added a bunch of everything that I came up without the help of guides on YouTube and so on.
